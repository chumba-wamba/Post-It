A generic social media clone developed using Python (Flask, FastAPI), MongoDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and BootStrap. The web-app is developed using Flask for the back-end and generic HTML-CSS-JS, and Bootstrap for the frontend, alongside FastAPI to handle all the MongoDB interactions. Future plans include to develop an Android app using Flutter.

To do:

- Draw sequence, architecture, and/or use-case diagrams.
- Code the Backend to interact with the API.
- Code the models for MongoDB in MongoEngine. ✔
- Code MongoEngine functions for database interaction. ✔
- Code API to interact with the database.
- Design and code the front-end.
